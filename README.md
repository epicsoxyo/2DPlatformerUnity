2.  Open the project in Unity
3.  Run the project

### Description

I made these two levels during the first two weeks of my master's degree in computer games development at Manchester Metropolitan University. The aim is to collect as many coins as you can before making your way to the exit. In total, this took me around 10 hours to make.

This was my first exposure to creating a game with the Unity Engine. We were tasked with creating a 2D platformer level using the assets we were given. During this time, I learned:
- How to navigate and use some basic features of Unity2D
- How to use sound effects
- A simple method of creating a parallax background effect
- How to handle player input from within a character controller script

This project is certainly far from perfect, but I am proud of how much I learned in such a short period of time. Considering this was only the second week of my games development journey, I'm quite happy with how it turned out!
